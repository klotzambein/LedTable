# LedTable
A simple 32x32 Led Table

## Research
* Price:
    * Leds needed: 1024 -> aka 4x 60 * 5 Ledstrips each 15€ = 60 (probably less)
    * arduino: already obtained
    * opaque material: 50€ (should be reducable witwith glas and paper)
    * building material: 20€
    * Interface: 20€
    * Total: 50-150€
* Library: FastLed
    * should be able to drive 1024 leds at 30hz
* Features:
    * Animations
    * Text
    * Locally customizable (Buttons and switches)
    * Reactive to Sound
    * (Bluetooth)
    * (SD card)
